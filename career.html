    <h2> MyJobGlasses Interview</h2>
    <p>
      As part of my career exploration, I had an interview on <strong>MyJobGlasses</strong> with a professional in the engineering and data field.  
      This experience helped me gain valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of the industry, and refine my understanding of the skills that matter most.  
      It was also a great opportunity to discuss professional paths, work-life balance, and advice for early-career engineers.
    </p>
    <h3>Interview with Jean-Louis – IT Architect</h3>
    <p>I had the opportunity to interview Jean-Louis Moser, an experienced IT Architect with a rich and diverse career. Jean-Louis began his professional journey in the defense sector at Matra, where he developed test benches for missile testing. It was during this time that he worked with assembly code, a skill that was vital in that era. His career took an interesting turn as he moved into the field of photocomposition, working on the layout of newspapers at a time when print media was still using lead typesetting and before word processing software had emerged. He even had a brief stint in a comic book factory before moving on to new challenges.</p>
    <p>As the computer industry evolved, word processing tools began to change the landscape of many businesses. Unfortunately, the company he was working for at the time couldn’t adapt fast enough and eventually went under. This setback led him to seek new opportunities, which he found at Capgemini in the late 1990s. There, he worked on managing IT systems, where he gained valuable insights into the varying levels of system criticality across industries. For example, he explained how organizations like INSEE could afford some downtime in their systems, but for industries like online gambling, the systems had to run seamlessly at all times to avoid catastrophic losses.</p>
    <p>ean-Louis also served as a project manager in geomatics, where he worked on a project for the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture. The aim of the project was to prevent urban sprawl on fertile land, and he and his team developed a solution to digitize the Egyptian land registry. He was responsible not only for the technical aspects of the project but also for training Egyptian officials and technicians, which involved traveling to Egypt to conduct training sessions.</p>
    <p>Another key part of Jean-Louis’ career has been his work as a master of requirements gathering. In this role, he helped clients articulate their needs and constraints to create clear and well-defined specifications for tenders. His ability to bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs has been a hallmark of his work.</p>
    <p>Jean-Louis describes himself as "a specialist in everything and an expert in nothing." This humble description captures the essence of his career. His role as an IT Architect has allowed him to gain experience across a wide range of fields, and his work has been characterized by continuous learning and adaptation to new challenges. His career serves as a testament to the breadth of opportunities that can arise in the IT sector, as well as the importance of versatility and problem-solving skills.</p>
